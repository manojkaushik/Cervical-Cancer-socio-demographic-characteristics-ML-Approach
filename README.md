# Cervical-Cancer

## Description

This study includes the dataset of cytokine gene variants, clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of normal healthy control subjects, and cervical cancer cases. Different risk factors, including demographic details and cytokine gene variants, were analysed using different machine learning approaches. Various statistical parameters were used for evaluating the proposed method. After multi-step data processing and random splitting of the dataset, machine learning methods were applied and evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation and also tested on the unseen data records of a collected dataset for proper evaluation and analysis. The proposed approaches were verified after analysing various performance metrics.
